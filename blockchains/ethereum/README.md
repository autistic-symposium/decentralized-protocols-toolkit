### tl; dr

<br>

##### evm execution 

* in native execution, evm will load the bytecode and execute the opcodes in the bytecodes one by one from the beginning.
* each opcode can be thought as doing the following steps:
  1. read elements from stack, memory, or storage
  2. perform some computation on these elements
  3. write back results to stack, memory, or storage

<br>

##### light clients

* light clients receive the block headers, which contain a merkle root (more on this later) that can be used to query full nodes to verify if a transaction is included in a particular block.

<br>

##### scaling

<br>

##### rollups tl; dr

* rollups move computation (and state storage) off-chain, but keep some data per tx on-chain, using compression tricks to replace data with computation wherever possible (but scalability is still limited by the data bandwidth of the underlying blockchain).
* an onchain smart contract maintains a state root (the merkle root) of the state of the rollup.
* anyone can publish a batch (collection of txs, compressed to form the previous state root and the new state root).
* the contract checks that the previous state root in the batch matches the current state root - if not, it switches the state root to the new state root.
* for depositing and withdrawing, txs can have input or output outside the rollup state (processed within the batches).
* optimistic (fraud proof) or zk (validity proof) rollups are solutions to know that the post-state roots in the batches are correct.

<br>

* optimistic l2s 
  * arbitrum one
    - started rollups
    - largest TVL
  * optimism
    - rollup from optimism collective, with a rich ecosystem of l2
    - tool to create l2 part of the superchain
  * mantle
    - l2 from bitdao

* zk-rollups l2s
  - zksync era
    - the leading zk-rollup and a zkevm (zk-rollups that use ethereum virtual machine to execute transactions are called zkevms)
    - the only zkevm that supports native account abstraction in the consensus layer of the chain
* starknet
  - zk-rollups from starkware
  - not a zkevm
  - used the cairo language
  - has recently open-souced their STARK prover
* polygon zkevm
  - part of polygon 2.0, an ecosystem of zk-rollups
  - converting polygon pos into a zk-validum
  - has their prover open-sourced
* linea
  - another recent zkevm from consensys
